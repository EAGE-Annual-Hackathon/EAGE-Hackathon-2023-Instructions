# EAGE-Annual-Hackathon-2023
Hackathon at the 84rd EAGE Annual Conference, Vienna

# Theme: Natural Language Processing in the Geosciences and Engineering

# Participant Guide

This event will be facilitated in English.

## What you need to do as a hackathon participant:
1. Before the hackathon: Find a team if you donâ€™t already have one.  We will use a Github discussion board â€“ so if you are looking for a team to join or have a topic that you would like some people to help you work on â€“ please post.
- There will be some time on Sunday morning to finalize the teams, but the expectation is that you have tried to find a team upfront.
2. Before the hackathon: Get your team ready!
- If you are attending remotely â€“ find a good place for you or your team to work with good internet connection â€“ coffee shop, somewhere at the university, or at a teammateâ€™s home.  We highly recommend that those attending remotely from the same city try to collocate in person even if you arenâ€™t on the same team!
- If you are coming to Madrid â€“ you will need to bring your laptop, headset, and power cable.
- Ideate around the technical challenge your team will work on.  You can use our Github discussion board for this.  Remember the theme!
- What data do you need?
- Are you going to use an existing model or build one from scratch?
 - What technology will your team use (python packages, dashboards, interpreters..etc)
The facilitators will provide some ideas to get you thinking - you can find this thread in the discussion board above.
3. Familiarize yourself with the agenda.
- This is a fairly short hackathon.  Your team will be expected to present your final outcome on Monday afternoon at 15:00.  That means code freeze will happen at 13:00.
- With your team, try to come up with a plan of attack keeping in mind the short time.
4. Yes, there will be a final presentation from each team with two teams up for award from a judging panel of experts and from the hackathon participants.
- The facilitators will reveal the criteria for the presentation Monday morning (this is so you can focus on your work and not on creating a presentation ðŸ˜Š)
- Remember to take screenshots, record methods, and document your thought process along the way â€“ this will help you to faster put together a final presentation.
5. Final presentation session will be recorded.
